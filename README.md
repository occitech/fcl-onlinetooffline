## Theme Online to Offline - Overview
This theme is a *mobile first theme* created to illustrate the fact that, while we are in movement, we are doing a lot of things, including buying products. Mobile e-commerce is growing really fast and consumers need applications answering their goals and needs.

With this theme, we’re giving consumers the possibility to combine both online and offline buying experiences, into one. When we’re buying a product online, there’s often a little concern about the matching between what we’re seeing on screen and what will be deliver to us. Because we couldn’t first test the product by ourselves before validating our order.  We tried to resolve that issue in this theme.

Instead of adding products to their cart and proceed a classic order process, users have the possibility to « Test the product in a store » first. They are invited to select a Store location and a Date, then, their order is « paused » until they test the product and decide to finally buy it or not. This choice gives users the feeling to be « in-control » and not depending of the brand they’re buying from. Trust grows between the brand and its consumers and it benefits both.
